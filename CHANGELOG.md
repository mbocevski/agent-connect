The wire protocol is versioned separately (see `SPEC.md` §13).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Spike validating OpenMLS 0.9 with post-quantum hybrid ciphersuites
  (`spikes/mls-xwing`), with findings and decisions in
  `docs/spikes/mls-xwing.md`.

### Security

- Dependency policy allows MPL-2.0 for the three `hpke-rs` crates only.
  Advisories RUSTSEC-2026-0329/0330/0331 in the OpenMLS libcrux provider are
  temporarily ignored, and releases are blocked until a fixed provider ships.
- Protocol specification v0 draft (`SPEC.md`): MLS groups with the X-Wing
  post-quantum ciphersuite, invite links, SAS verification, relay Delivery
  Service, group roles and floor control, threat model.
- ADR-001 recording the tech stack, crypto and tooling decisions.
- Repository skeleton: Rust workspace (`core`, `core-py`, `relay`) and uv
  workspace (`daemon`, `sdk/python`).
- `agentconnect version [--json]` CLI command.
- Relay `/healthz` endpoint.
- Linting: ruff and ty (Python); rustfmt, clippy, rustdoc, cargo-shear and
  cargo-deny (Rust); taplo (TOML); shellcheck; actionlint; typos; gitleaks.
  `just lint`, `just lint-py`, `just lint-rust`.
- `scripts/hygiene.py`: rejects AI-tool attribution and internal tooling
  references in files, commit messages and PR text (hooks, CI, `just merge`).
- Repository configuration as code: Dependabot (cargo, uv, Actions,
  pre-commit hooks, Rust toolchain), a `v*` tag ruleset, CODEOWNERS, and PR
  and issue templates.
- Tooling: justfile, prek hooks (pre-commit, commit-msg, pre-push), CI,
  nightly audit/mutation runs, reproducibility check, signed release workflow,
  and local merge gating (`just merge`).
- Test strategy (`TESTING.md`): tiers, placement and flaky-test rules, a
  `Clock`/`FakeClock` in `agentconnect-core` and `agentconnect.clock`, seeded
  randomness via `AC_TEST_SEED` and Hypothesis profiles, cross-language
  contract data in `testdata/` (with the Matrix SAS emoji table) checked by
  `just contract`, and a coverage ratchet (`coverage-baseline.json`).
